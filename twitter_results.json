If there was an obvious situation where he was giving preference to certain agents in return for something i would be the first to call it out, but he explains his reasoning every time. There are several cases where I totally disagreed with his opinion also, and i even let him know it…. But like… who cares lol. You DONT have to make a decision based off what he says. I just really dont get this way of thinking tbh. Theres far worse shit going on with the manipulation of the virgen point system in @virtuals_io. Wallet hopping is still happening from what i am being told from smart on-chain sleuths. You realize this is far far more responsible for extraction from the ecosystem and the price action of genesis agents than Vaders fuckin tier list lol. Not to mention the underlying macro situation, you know… the literal series of events that people have been saying would precede WW3 for like two decades. If y’all put 1/3rd of this Vader hate/blame effort into actually identifying and exposing the bad actors, we would have an even healthier ecosystem. And Vader is NOT a bad actor…. Trust me the sleuths have been analyzing the shit out of his wallets…. If anyone could take advantage of their situation and try to be sneaky etc… its him, and he has not done that. $Vader is on some centralized exchanges (shittier ones) so he could send tokens there and launder them to fresh wallets and just max extract…. Hasnt done it. Furthermore its his contributions in the form of Virtual genesis, that basically got totally ripped off from him… which he developed with lots of his own money putting in 12-15 hour days for 2+ months straight…. The reason we are all here in Virtuals szn 2. I highly doubt he has even made himself whole from that investment. The man has his reasons and his views, and to be honest his framework of reasoning is far superior than that of some guy who just calls out worthless meme coins so that they can dump on their followers… which is pretty much what we had for trench leaders before Virtuals. So you disagree with it? So fkn what… maybe he disagrees with you? Disagree with the opinion, make your choice with your money, and move on. Vader isnt deciding the fate of a project, thats in the hands of the team and their ability to ship with PMF. Stop giving him that much credit/power…. Its laughable. Start finding the real bad actors who are actually fucking extracting and expose them. They fly under the radar and youre just targeting the lowest hanging fruit you can find to assign blame… which doesn’t even hold up logically. This dumb shit always happens when the market dumps. The baddies are out there…. Youre going after the wrong dude.",

      "text": "We Just Got THE Trading Intelligence Edge Virgens, are you an active coin trader? Do you use DEXscreener and look at wallet transactions when trading? If so, you are missing out on the full story, but $SWARM holders just got access to ALL the useful data, giving them the edge! While we are all waiting for the @virtuals_io Autonomous Hedge Fund ACP to go live and start trading funds for us, you can now already use some of the same WalletDNA data that @TheSWARM_ai uses within the ACP for yourself! That product is called SWARMcopilot and is now live to download on the Google Play store as a Chrome Extension! So, what does it do? In short, it tells you the full story about what every wallet buying and selling a token has done to help you gage if smart money is buying, giving you insights into whether or not it’s a good time to buy the token! Let’s dive into the full details about how it works: SWARMcopilot adds data intelligence to popular blockchain dApps for quick, context-aware analysis. Currently, it’s live on every ERC-20 token page on DEXscreener for Ethereum and Base, with support coming soon wherever you trade. WalletDNA reveals live behavioral insights for each interacting wallet: when they enter, how they hold, and how they impact markets. Powered by $SWARM and 250+ terabytes of on-chain data from @cryptoslamio, the extension decodes smart money using five core traits: 1) Intelligence (IQ) – Measures execution quality via realized PnL. High scores = elite exits and profitable timing. 2) Flow – Tracks net buy/sell volume to reveal market-moving wallets. 3) Epoch – Scores how early a wallet entered a token’s lifecycle. 4) Mass – Quantifies how much of a token's supply a wallet controls. 5) Reputation – Grades post-entry behavior—holding with conviction vs. exiting early. No static tags. No guesswork. Just actionable, dynamic intelligence - live and in context. Want to see an example of how this can be used? Check out this example from my guy @Hudah_Idiot : Want access? Of course you do! Currently, you need to stake $SWARM for access to SWARMcopilot. What’s cool is your reputation score matters and effects how much $SWARM you need to stake for access! The better your wallet reputation, the cheaper it is to access! Check out the screenshot of my connected wallet as an example. Because my wallet has an “A” reputation, access to SWARMcopilot only cost 25k staked $SWARM (which currently is ~$280). The lower your reputation grade, the more staked $SWARM you will need to access SWARMcopilot, up to 100k $SWARM (hope you have a good reputation 😼) What you are getting can make up that cost quickly! All this data is LIVE as trades are happening, providing much better instant info than even Nansen can provide! The product is amazing already and still being built out even further 💪 Want to know if someone who receives an airdrop from your InfoFi campaign has just dumped it immediately? 🪂 That behavior will be reflected in their Wallet DNA reputation score. 🫣 Soon, a trader’s reputation will even be established across wallets! 👀 Thus, if that same person who receives an airdrop decides to transfer the airdrop through multiple wallets and then dump it, Wallet DNA will track that data and apply the Reputation score across all the connected wallets 🤯 Data is Digital Gold, and @cryptoslamio (the OG team behind $SWARM) are the Fort Knox of blockchain data! 🪙 This is the future of trading intelligence, and if you are a $SWARM holder, the future is now! If you found this content useful, please like, RT, and be sure to give me a follow! If you have any questions about $SWARM, SWARMcopilot, Wallet DNA, or ACP questions in general, let me know in the comments and I will see what I can find to share the answers with the Virgen fam!",

We have burn and upgrade mechanics to balance the supply flow, but it is not enough. Reverse league is fun, but it incentivizes players to NOT burn useless cards, and creates an overhang supply on the marketplace. Elite, on the other hand, is harder and harder to compete.

For a deck with 5 Legendary cards, 625 commons were burned. Think about it, you are running a business. One customer group buys and re-buys your product constantly, another buys, gets the promotion, and is more likely to re-sell on eBay. Which one should you reward more? It is just business.",

But 2 key areas still lack clarity. Right now, it’s still full of ambiguity 👇 👇 🔹 (A) “Agents with good Product and fundamentals get more points” Sounds great.

Then, after BID goes down the drain because it's another copy pasta launchpad, make some BS post about how it was a failure from the beginning.
