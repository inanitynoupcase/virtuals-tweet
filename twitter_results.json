Your $ returns per point spent are more important than $ returns per $VIRTUAL spent. While you can get 100x - 1000x in terms of $VIRTUAL spent on hyped launches, most users are making very little in terms of raw dollars because they can only allocate a few $VIRTUAL tokens on the most hyped launches. For example, $IRIS gave $0.010 per a point spent. Not great, not terrible. Sure, it was a safer play because you were guaranteed to get huge returns per $VIRTUAL spent, but you also received only $0.010 per a point spent.
