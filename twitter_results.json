There are several cases where I totally disagreed with his opinion also, and i even let him know it…. But like… who cares lol. You DONT have to make a decision based off what he says. I just really dont get this way of thinking tbh. Theres far worse shit going on with the manipulation of the virgen point system in @virtuals_io. Wallet hopping is still happening from what i am being told from smart on-chain sleuths. You realize this is far far more responsible for extraction from the ecosystem and the price action of genesis agents than Vaders fuckin tier list lol. Not to mention the underlying macro situation, you know… the literal series of events that people have been saying would precede WW3 for like two decades. If y’all put 1/3rd of this Vader hate/blame effort into actually identifying and exposing the bad actors, we would have an even healthier ecosystem. And Vader is NOT a bad actor…. Trust me the sleuths have been analyzing the shit out of his wallets…. If anyone could take advantage of their situation and try to be sneaky etc… its him, and he has not done that. $Vader is on some centralized exchanges (shittier ones) so he could send tokens there and launder them to fresh wallets and just max extract…. Hasnt done it. Furthermore its his contributions in the form of Virtual genesis, that basically got totally ripped off from him… which he developed with lots of his own money putting in 12-15 hour days for 2+ months straight…. The reason we are all here in Virtuals szn 2. I highly doubt he has even made himself whole from that investment. The man has his reasons and his views, and to be honest his framework of reasoning is far superior than that of some guy who just calls out worthless meme coins so that they can dump on their followers… which is pretty much what we had for trench leaders before Virtuals. So you disagree with it? So fkn what… maybe he disagrees with you? Disagree with the opinion, make your choice with your money, and move on. Vader isnt deciding the fate of a project, thats in the hands of the team and their ability to ship with PMF. Stop giving him that much credit/power…. Its laughable. Start finding the real bad actors who are actually fucking extracting and expose them. They fly under the radar and youre just targeting the lowest hanging fruit you can find to assign blame… which doesn’t even hold up logically. This dumb shit always happens when the market dumps. The baddies are out there…. Youre going after the wrong dude.",

      "text": "We Just Got THE Trading Intelligence Edge Virgens, are you an active coin trader? Do you use DEXscreener and look at wallet transactions when trading? If so, you are missing out on the full story, but $SWARM holders just got access to ALL the useful data, giving them the edge! While we are all waiting for the @virtuals_io Autonomous Hedge Fund ACP to go live and start trading funds for us, you can now already use some of the same WalletDNA data that @TheSWARM_ai uses within the ACP for yourself! That product is called SWARMcopilot and is now live to download on the Google Play store as a Chrome Extension! So, what does it do? In short, it tells you the full story about what every wallet buying and selling a token has done to help you gage if smart money is buying, giving you insights into whether or not it’s a good time to buy the token! Let’s dive into the full details about how it works: SWARMcopilot adds data intelligence to popular blockchain dApps for quick, context-aware analysis. Currently, it’s live on every ERC-20 token page on DEXscreener for Ethereum and Base, with support coming soon wherever you trade. WalletDNA reveals live behavioral insights for each interacting wallet: when they enter, how they hold, and how they impact markets. Powered by $SWARM and 250+ terabytes of on-chain data from @cryptoslamio, the extension decodes smart money using five core traits: 1) Intelligence (IQ) – Measures execution quality via realized PnL. High scores = elite exits and profitable timing. 2) Flow – Tracks net buy/sell volume to reveal market-moving wallets. 3) Epoch – Scores how early a wallet entered a token’s lifecycle. 4) Mass – Quantifies how much of a token's supply a wallet controls. 5) Reputation – Grades post-entry behavior—holding with conviction vs. exiting early. No static tags. No guesswork. Just actionable, dynamic intelligence - live and in context. Want to see an example of how this can be used? Check out this example from my guy @Hudah_Idiot : Want access? Of course you do! Currently, you need to stake $SWARM for access to SWARMcopilot. What’s cool is your reputation score matters and effects how much $SWARM you need to stake for access! The better your wallet reputation, the cheaper it is to access! Check out the screenshot of my connected wallet as an example. Because my wallet has an “A” reputation, access to SWARMcopilot only cost 25k staked $SWARM (which currently is ~$280). The lower your reputation grade, the more staked $SWARM you will need to access SWARMcopilot, up to 100k $SWARM (hope you have a good reputation 😼) What you are getting can make up that cost quickly! All this data is LIVE as trades are happening, providing much better instant info than even Nansen can provide! The product is amazing already and still being built out even further 💪 Want to know if someone who receives an airdrop from your InfoFi campaign has just dumped it immediately? 🪂 That behavior will be reflected in their Wallet DNA reputation score. 🫣 Soon, a trader’s reputation will even be established across wallets! 👀 Thus, if that same person who receives an airdrop decides to transfer the airdrop through multiple wallets and then dump it, Wallet DNA will track that data and apply the Reputation score across all the connected wallets 🤯 Data is Digital Gold, and @cryptoslamio (the OG team behind $SWARM) are the Fort Knox of blockchain data! 🪙 This is the future of trading intelligence, and if you are a $SWARM holder, the future is now! If you found this content useful, please like, RT, and be sure to give me a follow! If you have any questions about $SWARM, SWARMcopilot, Wallet DNA, or ACP questions in general, let me know in the comments and I will see what I can find to share the answers with the Virgen fam!",
      "raw_text": "We Just Got THE Trading Intelligence Edge\n\nVirgens, are you an active coin trader?\n\nDo you use DEXscreener and look at wallet transactions when trading?\n\nIf so, you are missing out on the full story, but $SWARM holders just got access to ALL the useful data, giving them the edge!\n\nWhile we are all waiting for the @virtuals_io Autonomous Hedge Fund ACP to go live and start trading funds for us, you can now already use some of the same WalletDNA data that @TheSWARM_ai uses within the ACP for yourself!\n\nThat product is called SWARMcopilot and is now live to download on the Google Play store as a Chrome Extension!\n\nhttps://t.co/58RrrlhcKd\n\nSo, what does it do? \n\nIn short, it tells you the full story about what every wallet buying and selling a token has done to help you gage if smart money is buying, giving you insights into whether or not it’s a good time to buy the token!\n\nLet’s dive into the full details about how it works:\n\nSWARMcopilot adds data intelligence to popular blockchain dApps for quick, context-aware analysis.\n\nCurrently, it’s live on every ERC-20 token page on DEXscreener for Ethereum and Base, with support coming soon wherever you trade.\n\nWalletDNA reveals live behavioral insights for each interacting wallet: when they enter, how they hold, and how they impact markets.\n\nPowered by $SWARM and 250+ terabytes of on-chain data from @cryptoslamio, the extension decodes smart money using five core traits:\n\n1) Intelligence (IQ) – Measures execution quality via realized PnL. High scores = elite exits and profitable timing.\n\n2) Flow – Tracks net buy/sell volume to reveal market-moving wallets.\n\n3) Epoch – Scores how early a wallet entered a token’s lifecycle.\n\n4) Mass – Quantifies how much of a token's supply a wallet controls.\n\n5) Reputation – Grades post-entry behavior—holding with conviction vs. exiting early.\n\nNo static tags. \n\nNo guesswork. \n\nJust actionable, dynamic intelligence - live and in context.\n\nWant to see an example of how this can be used?\n\nCheck out this example from my guy @Hudah_Idiot : \n\nhttps://t.co/15ZWJmqHZZ\n\nWant access?

      "text": "UPDATE ON HOW TO MULTIPLY $EVA POINTS Even though we didn't quite reach the thresholds mentioned in my quoted post to unlock some additional alpha, I am going to deliver some more yapping alpha for you anyways fam out of love for the Virgens! There's now 129 people on the @EvaOnlineXyz Yapping Leaderboard, but that means it’s still pretty early! In the previous posts, I reviewed how Base Points are calculated along with how to Boost points. Remember fam, this leaderboard DOESN'T USE KAITO! This formula is the great product of @SongjamSpace and the additional help for the leaderboard that I will share in this post is the MULTIPLIER equation they created (see screenshot below), giving you more points the earlier you post! Note: The dividing number for the @EvaOnlineXyz yapping points is 780447 instead of 604800 (based on the number of seconds between launch of campaign and $EVA TGE) Want some real alpha fam? Rumor has it, you also get a 20% points boost if you also tag @SongjamSpace in your posts about $EVA (you didn’t hear it from me 🤫) Alright fam, help me get those points boosts by hitting the like, RT, QT, and bookmark of this (or any of my other $EVA posts)! Also, make sure to comment with your thoughts about the project and this fantastic yapping formula! Let's get to yapping Virgens!",

New BID Level formula is based on 4 key things: 1: BID staked (50%) - The more you stake, and the longer it’s locked, the more you earn 2: Agent tokens staked (20%) - Holding > jeeting 3: Agent token buys (15%) - Fresh buys in the last 7 days give your score a push 4: Social score (15%) - Show up, yap, rank. You need 2500 $BID staked to even start earning this. Unstake or stay silent? Your score drops. Sell early? You get punished. 🔹Unstake $BID or agent tokens = lower score 🔹Don’t buy? No boost 🔹Don’t yap? No social score 🔹Sell before 30 days? Say goodbye to your level and prepare for cooldown Selling triggers penalties: 🔹Drop 5 BID levels 🔹Hit Level 0? You’re locked out of the next 7 launches 🔹Level 1? You get reset to 0 🔹Level 2–5? You get sent to Level 1 🔹Level 6+? You still drop 5 levels After 30 days of holding or staking, you’re safe. Play long-term, win long-term. Tokenomics for curated launches are simple and fair: 🔹30% Team and Treasury. Vested with locked emissions 🔹20% Conviction Vault, for real holders and community campaigns 🔹37.5% Pre-sale, level-weighted, fixed price 🔹12.5% Liquidity, locked, paired with $BID, ETH or BNB Bottom line: @CreatorBid V2 isn’t made for yield farmers.

      "text": "Few people know this about me, but one of my first business endeavors was scaling a family business. The goal was to turn a youth basketball coaching business into a power-house youth basketball club for boys and girls age 10-18. It took years but we got it there, currently with over 30 teams, many competing in the top tournaments locally and internationally. Being involved in a sports club by coaching teams, managing operations, and building community is something truly special. There's an emotional bond you build with the teams and the community around them. I have since moved on, but miss the vibes. So when @LegendAI_Agent came my way, I knew I wanted to be a part of it. This project taps into the magic of sports ownership, community, and striving for sports success, while $LEGEND opens the doors for everyone to get involved into this unique experience typically reserved only for the few. By thoughtfully blending AI and crypto, LEGEND empowers supporters to genuinely participate in key club decisions, from management to strategies on the pitch. It reminds me of Wrexham AFC, the club revitalized by @VancityReynolds and @RMcElhenney. They were able to bring passion, community, and energy into the club's destiny. LEGEND seeks to bring a similar spirit to Costa D’Amalfi FC. The journey is going to be like something we've never seen before in sports, and there's a lot more to share in the pipeline. The $LEGEND token launch is past the required pledging requirement on @virtuals_io and will go live today, and if you feel the same connection, I highly recommend being early to this very special opportunity. For full transparency, I work closely with the team as an advisor, and everything in this post comes from very close personal experience working in Sports, Crypto, and AI.",

If you play @fantasy_top_, you know we are having hyperinflation in Cards. The total supply used to be 180k last year, now we are at 280k. We have burn and upgrade mechanics to balance the supply flow, but it is not enough. Reverse league is fun, but it incentivizes players to NOT burn useless cards, and creates an overhang supply on the marketplace. Elite, on the other hand, is harder and harder to compete. You are required to upgrade constantly, in order to maintain your portfolio strength. The final target is Legendary cards, which equals 125 common cards. For a deck with 5 Legendary cards, 625 commons were burned. Think about it, you are running a business. One customer group buys and re-buys your product constantly, another buys, gets the promotion, and is more likely to re-sell on eBay. Which one should you reward more? It is just business.",

      "text": "💎 @CreatorBid is gaining real traction! It’s the distribution layer for Bittensor ($TAO) agents. But wait… what is TAO and what are Subnets? 🔍 What is TAO Network? TAO by @opentensor is a decentralized AI network where anyone can contribute: • Computing power • AI models • Training data Contributors are rewarded in $TAO based on the value they bring. 🏗️ What are Subnets in TAO? Think of subnets like mini AI ecosystems within TAO. Each subnet focuses on a specific task—NLP, image generation, coding, etc. They operate independently and compete to provide the most valuable AI services. ⚙️ Why Subnets? •Specialization = better performance •Open + decentralized AI infrastructure •You can run one, build on one, or stake on one •Subnets earn $TAO based on quality & performance 🔥 As of June 2025, there are 125+ active subnets, and the number keeps growing. Each one is like an AI startup in its own vertical. Here are 15 of the most popular subnets and what they focus on 🧵 🧠 Subnet 64 – Chutes Focus: Serverless AI compute (e.g., run open-source models like DeepSeek). Provides GPU compute infra for decentralized inference. 📊 Subnet 4 – Targon Focus: Verifying AI responses and multimodal inference. Backbone of apps like Dippy AI (fact-checking + smart routing). 🧬 Subnet 56 – Gradients Focus: Training massive open-source AI models (100T+ params). SOTA model training at decentralized scale. 🖼️ Subnet 19 – Nineteen Focus: High-throughput image generation & visual inference. Decentralized alt to Midjourney/Stable Diffusion. 🔍 Subnet 34 – BitMind Focus: Deepfake detection & digital forensics. Even won Coinbase Developer Award. 📡 Subnet 13 – Data Universe Focus: Data scraping (Twitter/X, Reddit, etc). Feeds real-time info into other AI models. 💻 Subnet 42 – Gen42 Focus: AI coding assistant.

      "text": "Gvirgen, enlighten me on a few things. I’m trying to make sense of all this 🤔🧠 🤔 Currently, holding a single large-cap agent token (stable, popular, and highly valued) is far more rewarding than holding 100 agents, simply because points are calculated based on total USD value. 💬 Solution: A multiplier system based on the number of staked agents (not token), not just their value, is urgently needed. Why this matters: ✅ Prevents points from being concentrated in just 1–2 large tokens ✅ Encourages broader participation across the ecosystem ✅ Provides fairer opportunities for smaller, yet solid, agents However, several critical aspects still lack transparency 👇 🔹 (a) “Good product + strong fundamentals = more points” → What are the KPIs? Are they publicly defined? → If the Virtuals team serves as both executive and legislative, that’s undemocratic and creates a clear conflict of interest. 🔹 (b) Who exactly qualifies as a “dev”? → Is it the wallet that launched the agent? → Is it a person? The Founder? → If it’s the project founder, even if they bought tokens from the market using personal funds — not from an allocation? → Are treasury or company wallets considered “dev wallets”? 💬 Solution: Publicly tag all dev-related wallets (e.g., “Virtual Dev”) on-chain. This would eliminate ambiguity and potential bias. 🧠 Transparency = Trust The current point distribution system remains one of the most urgent and unresolved concerns. Everyone sees the issue — yet no meaningful action has been taken. I provide criticism and solutions, From the bottom of my heart, i hope @virtuals_io will be better 🙂",

      "text": "Sharing my thoughts on the Genesis Launches The success of a genesis launch is determined by a combination of - Product attractiveness - Product readiness - Narrative & story-telling - Token value accrual - Roadmap & growth accelerants - Team experience & credentials Each of these criteria do not get the same weights and every week the weights shift depending on the meta happening on @virtuals_io We've shifted from focusing points into Virtuals Top 10 Hackthon Winners to selectively backing unique product with good narratives Credentials still matter the most for high profile launches as seen from $IRIS (which is a partnership between Virtuals x Nethermind) Based on past launches & upcoming launches, the types of product that get launched a lot are • Security-focused product ➔ smart contract audit, security testing, txn simulation • Trading analytics ➔ trading signals, sentiment analytics, news, onchain analytics, etc Security-focused products are great and offer a lot of value BUT scaling & monetizing them are difficult. Plus, it's hard to engage w/ the community (can't flex 100% return of 10x gains like trading analytics) Trading analytics products offer the solutions to the problem that the general retail audience is facing \"how to make more money\". But, not all analytics tools are created equal—only a handful who have proprietary data or insights derived from unique sources tend to perform better than peers Since it's clear that the Virtuals direction is all about generating economic value through ACP (especially for the initial ACP clusters), teams that offer unique expertise/value to be a part of ACP, will receive a credential boost which equates to price appreciation The first two clusters have shown a very clear trend on this where ACP projects outperform the rest of the Virtuals agents Anyhow, back to Genesis Launch. The structure of Genesis Launch is not optimal for VC-backed or angel-backed projects to launch since almost half of the supply will be sold off at $200k FDV (to Virtuals community). This is why we're seeing projects launching tokens with only a roadmap or in some cases an alpha version of the product (pre-MVP). Building a good product requires initial $$$ to bootstrap the project, to pay for devs, pay for compute/inference, pay for ops & infra cost AND most builders do not have the luxury to bootstrap their projects w/ their own capital for an extended period of time. So if you see a project with product ready on Day 1 generating initial traction & revenue, that's very unique on Virtuals and has high likelihood of finding PMF. Take @BasisOS as the case study—useful Defi product from Day 1, clear value accrual, unique product, defi-native team w/ experience in basis trading. Everybody has their own opinion on this but when I analyze a Genesis Launch, I look at - The category of the product first—whether the problem they're solving is unique and whether the addressable market is large enough - Narrative & story-telling—how good are they at communicating, building community and weaving together narratives - Team credentials & Roadmap—how experience is the team, whether they're serial entrepreneur, or if they could likely become a part of the ACP - Token value accrual—utility for the token, does it make sense to have a token? does token act as growth lever? or is token the product? Obviously AI does matter, but not as much as the above. So what does this mean Jeff? tl;dr pls ➔ Identify unique product solving unique problems, the more ready the better ➔ Look for teams that know how to tell a story. Virtuals is a master storyteller. If a team has a fraction of Virtuals storytelling skill, that's the one to keep an eye on cuz at the end of the day, hype & speculation is driven by exciting narratives/stories ➔ Credentials is always important so look for teams w/ extensive experience in w/e they're doing. Which upcoming launches am I excited for? - $STRATOS ➔ for the reasons outlined in my Stratos post - $ROOM ➔ InfoFi/SocialFi enhanced by AI is an interesting product proposition - $PILOT ➔ Very unique AI companions modeled after real experts / OGs, giving advices to builders (I wish there's better incentive mechanism that incentivizes experts to train/refine/promote their companion better tho) - $SANG ➔ Agentic CRM for X spaces + Voice Verification Network + AI Voice data set (allowing you to monetize your voice data & spin up voice agents). Business process automation (BPA) / vertical ai agents are super common in Web2 but not Web3. Glad to see more of it here. (Not sure about the size of Web3 X spaces TAM though but they certainly have a pretty unique product) Personal Note: That's pretty much it! Again, this is NFA.
