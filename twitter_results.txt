I just got onboard @virtuals_io yesterday together with @ST33RT @Pumpbob_ and @SusanooSOL . We were totally clueless of how it works, got $10K of $VADER but stacking at virtual platform was a wrong move lol. Got 14D of jailtime for FREE to unstake and restake at Vader's platform fml ü´† Back to @BasisOS and found out that I drop drastically #78 spots away from my previous position. Competition sure is getting tougher at $BIOS Time to grind harder and what is @useBackroom ?

Points are the most valuable asset in the @virtuals_io ecosystem. Be aggressive spending points where you can get value, but cautious on hyped launches where points are heavily diluted. Your $ returns per point spent are more important than $ returns per $VIRTUAL spent. While you can get 100x - 1000x in terms of $VIRTUAL spent on hyped launches, most users are making very little in terms of raw dollars because they can only allocate a few $VIRTUAL tokens on the most hyped launches. For example, $IRIS gave $0.010 per a point spent. Not great, not terrible. Sure, it was a safer play because you were guaranteed to get huge returns per $VIRTUAL spent, but you also received only $0.010 per a point spent. Twelve launches gave better $ returns per a point spent, including even the recent $DUCK @appduckai.

Staking $IRIS was a big mistake. I mean, if even I thought this, making someone from community think same is a huge failure Even if you‚Äôre going to get cooldown in next launches, selling is still much more reasonable than staking @virtuals_io

I‚Äôll give you this @MagicNewton alpha for free: ‚§∑ Magic newton agents are verifiable, autonomous programs that execute your intent onchain. ‚§∑ Under the hood, they run with zk + tee infra from Succinct, Risc Zero, Automata, Phala and more. ‚§∑ Every action taken by an agent is provable. no blind trust. no black boxes. ‚§∑ We‚Äôre entering a phase where users will be able to build, deploy, and even sell their agents in a real marketplace. The infra is live. Agents are live. The next phase is near. Are you ready for what‚Äôs coming this month?

Fellow Virgens, y‚Äôall refreshing the site like maniacs too, waiting for them sweet points? Wishing everyone to smash some new records today! While the points are still cooking, go do some alpha digging on upcoming Genesis Launches, stake some agents or 10,000 $VADER, and start yapping!

Sometimes not jeeting on your @virtuals_io Genesis allocations back fires you. I have invested around 300$ in virtuals bought some agents from market and staked them now my whole portfolio is worth around 350$ after $SOLACE and $IRIS genesis launch. $SOLACE was giving me 350$ at ATH now it's Giving me 50$ . $IRIS at ATH was giving 500$ now 150$. @ethermage lacks in communications as well trying to contact support of @virtuals_io regarding few of my transactions . No response on Telegram ( so many people just spamming and mod is inactive ) and in discord also same , Can't even enter.

There's so much noise in the info-fi space atm it's hard to know which projects to focus us. On top of that KAITO rewards creators for loyalty, meaning you ultimately get nerfed somewhat for trying to climb too many leaderboards. Focus on products that you actually use & have invested capital in. For me that means putting 99% of my content towards: @virtuals_io @katana @infinex @multibank_io Nobody wants to see the same updates about reward programs and where you are on the leaderboard in every post. We want to see what you are actually doing with those products. - How much money are you making? - What is your strategy? - How much capital are you risking? Such things actually help others make decisions and hopefully win together.

The $BAIBY launch I joined via @virtuals_io was way below my expectations. I ended up staking all my tokens (not that I had much of a choice) Now I‚Äôm shifting my focus to @BasisOS. I‚Äôll still keep up with both, but $BIOS is definitely my main priority now. In crypto, take a pause before you quit Because the moments you feel like giving up the most‚Ä¶ are usually when things start turning around. (Manifesting this üòá)

My thoughts on how @useBackroom can be a long term hold after you pledge your Virgen points in the @virtuals_io genesis launch If it manages to onboard all the big KOLs & sustain the interest, it could be a runner. Will you be holding? ü§î

Don‚Äôt complain about your wins! I‚Äôve seen more and more people doing that lately, so disappointing. A 15x from $BAYBI is a solid profit Take it, stake it, and move on! Virtuals gives us so many opportunities, like @useBackroom and $BIOS We‚Äôre here for the 500x. The virgen community is getting stronger day by day. The plan is simple: stake $VADER and Virtuals, create good content and enjoy the ride This feels just like 2021 for NFTs.

Ranked top 5 on the Kaito Virtuals leaderboard today Even after consistently supporting everyone, I‚Äôm still not on your list? I post around 10 tweets a day about @virtuals_io and $VADER plus I engage with top mindshare accounts and reply back under my own posts too. gVirtual

Still no @virtuals_io points for me, like everyone I guess.. But yesterday I took some time to stack a few Genesis Agent cuties: $BIOS, $IRIS, $BAIBY ‚Ä¶ All to boost my $VADER Virtuals points allocation. Hoping to hit 150,000 before $ROOM goes live üìà Quick reminder before $ROOM launches: @useBackroom leaderboard is still live and honestly worth it! üí∞ Keep trying to climb and keep collecting your yaps ( these yaps are not the same as Kaito yaps. they‚Äôre way easier.) Just post. Don‚Äôt overthink. And you? How do you boost your Virtuals points? üëÄ

Farming airdrops across chains? Yeah, I‚Äôve been there ‚Äî bridging, swapping, waiting‚Ä¶ it used to be a war. Then I discovered Swidging with @infinex. Now it‚Äôs fast, secure, and feels like second nature. Deposit ‚Üí Swidge ‚Üí Farm airdrop. No complicated UI. No bridging. No seed phrases. No unnecessary gas fees. 100% onchain. Just a smooth ride. If you‚Äôre serious about multi-chain airdrop farming, you need to try this. #Infinex
