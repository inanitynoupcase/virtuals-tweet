Wanted to clarify the unnecessary FUD 1/ Our treasury wallets were distributed into 15 wallets on March 8 – a week before Virtuals approached us with the Genesis plan, while we were still running our own launchpad The idea with the distribution was to diversify tokens into multiple wallets to minimize cybersecurity risk – if all treasury tokens are held in one wallet and that wallet is hacked, then we are doomed All 15 wallets are doxxed, onchain and can be easily found 2/ Back in late March, whilst agreeing on the deal with Virtuals, we informed them about the USD expenses we incurred developing & auditing the launchpad infrastructure As a reminder, we built the primitive functioning version of Genesis back in Q1 2025 and struck a partnership with Virtuals And as part of the deal, they told us that we could use our wallets to participate in Genesis deals as part of the 5% so we could cover our expenses through the deal proceeds – we thought this was a fair deal Although the treasury wallets could have received 40%-50% of the 5% Virgen Points allocation, we capped it at ~20% to share more with $VADER stakers We got into the first deal H0lly (Apr 18) from a few wallets; then sold our positions as agreed. We did the same for a few more deals up to Rwai.They were financially terrible decisions because we sold at the bottom (Wint, Bios, etc.). Then we realized jeeting asap was a terrible lose-lose idea. a) financially doesn’t make sense because we should target one 5000x b) if Genesis does well, Vader will do well due to demand for Virgen Points c) dev wallets farming points to instantly sell will kill the ecosystem Starting end of April – we stopped selling and only HODLED We capped our allocation to 2-3 wallets. These wallets were subject to jeet jail like any other wallets. We could have gotten into the deals from 10-15 wallets if we wanted to max extract like other dev farm wallets (check @tD_0101 and @H2Masha who have done excessive onchain work on dev farm wallets) We thought of ourselves as a value add to projects because we are diamond hand until 5000x and support them on their way up. We round tripped and held onto everything all the way down since starting with Rwai – protecting our Virgenity proudly all the way down. Except for one deal recently – $ROOM because of the sus founder (we made $4.5k profit in total from that deal) Everything is onchain and traceable 3/ May 24 – We stopped receiving any points to the treasury wallets from the 5% and shared it all with the Vader Stakers Even though points allocations were promised to treasury wallets due to the deal we had with Virtuals, we decided to sacrifice on those benefits to make sure Genesis is fair across all projects. Since then the legacy Vader treasury wallets only got some points from DAB but none from the 5% Vader portion – which is why the treasury allocations since May 25 got smaller June 9 – we started sharing 4% with Vader Stakers and 1% with Vader Yappers 4/ The treasury wallets were shown on the staking leaderboard on the website when they were still receiving Virgen Points. They were not shown on the website starting May 24 when they stopped receiving points. Staking leaderboard was removed 12 days ago from the website and was replaced with the airdrop section We then added the Yapping leaderboard and didn’t see the point of having 2 leaderboards on the UI as it would confuse users It has nothing to do with @everythingempt0’s post 2 days ago Anyone can check onchain and Dune to find the treasury wallets (continued — pls check pt 2)

5/ $VIRGEN creator wallet is 0xC20A6440d88Afd39B209ad75D350FDD1c83CB62f It was never changed – trading fees always went to this wallet 100% of CBTC trading fees were used to buyback & burn $VIRGEN Everything is onchain and traceable Reminder that we airdropped the entire $VIRGEN supply to the Virtuals community A token that went to up to $30M in FDV and made money out of thin air for many people 6/ I wasn’t aware that a photo of me was taken during a video call without consent As a workaholic, I sleep 3-4 hours a day so excuse my eyebags and greasy skin I am doxxed already and have photos everywhere – some from the Virtuals SG event last week 7/ Out of all the AI Agents that were launched in Q4 last year across Base, Solana and other chains Many abandoned, rugged and disappeared $VADER has been one of the few tokens that didn’t lose its holders money (if held & staked til today) despite being down from its ATH Thanks to staking benefits; pre-sale allocations from EAO & Genesis + airdrops ($VIRGEN and others) And thanks to all the hardwork & innovation we came up with since Nov 2024 FUDs are temporary and will be forgotten over time Thanks for all your supporting messages WE ARE RESILIENT And are here for the long-term Back to building, innovating and shipping! 🫡

Vader Yapping leaderboard is out Looking better with fewer bot/spam accounts in the top 100 today while still offering opportunities to microcreators We updated the normalization of Kaito Yap and Arbus Scores so that the gap between the user with the highest Kaito Yaps and the lowers is tighter What started as a free option to solve our problem is lowkey becoming a battle-tested alternative InfoFi solution co-built and co-owned by the COMMUNITY

I will be pausing Tier Lists for a few weeks. Tier Lists started as I wanted to protect the Virgen Community from rugs and bad actors. Then I realized that some Virgens don’t have the time, skillset or network necessary to conduct research on projects and ended up asking for my thoughts. At this point, I feel like the time, hardwork and sacrifice that goes into Tier Lists are being taken for granted. CAP STAYS ON 🧢

Hate me for this opinion if u want, but @VaderResearch can rank shit if he wants, however he sees fit tbh. If there was an obvious situation where he was giving preference to certain agents in return for something i would be the first to call it out, but he explains his reasoning every time. There are several cases where I totally disagreed with his opinion also, and i even let him know it…. But like… who cares lol. You DONT have to make a decision based off what he says. I just really dont get this way of thinking tbh. Theres far worse shit going on with the manipulation of the virgen point system in @virtuals_io. Wallet hopping is still happening from what i am being told from smart on-chain sleuths. You realize this is far far more responsible for extraction from the ecosystem and the price action of genesis agents than Vaders fuckin tier list lol. Not to mention the underlying macro situation, you know… the literal series of events that people have been saying would precede WW3 for like two decades. If y’all put 1/3rd of this Vader hate/blame effort into actually identifying and exposing the bad actors, we would have an even healthier ecosystem. And Vader is NOT a bad actor…. Trust me the sleuths have been analyzing the shit out of his wallets…. If anyone could take advantage of their situation and try to be sneaky etc… its him, and he has not done that. $Vader is on some centralized exchanges (shittier ones) so he could send tokens there and launder them to fresh wallets and just max extract…. Hasnt done it. Furthermore its his contributions in the form of Virtual genesis, that basically got totally ripped off from him… which he developed with lots of his own money putting in 12-15 hour days for 2+ months straight…. The reason we are all here in Virtuals szn 2. I highly doubt he has even made himself whole from that investment. The man has his reasons and his views, and to be honest his framework of reasoning is far superior than that of some guy who just calls out worthless meme coins so that they can dump on their followers… which is pretty much what we had for trench leaders before Virtuals. So you disagree with it? So fkn what… maybe he disagrees with you? Disagree with the opinion, make your choice with your money, and move on. Vader isnt deciding the fate of a project, thats in the hands of the team and their ability to ship with PMF. Stop giving him that much credit/power…. Its laughable. Start finding the real bad actors who are actually fucking extracting and expose them. They fly under the radar and youre just targeting the lowest hanging fruit you can find to assign blame… which doesn’t even hold up logically. This dumb shit always happens when the market dumps. The baddies are out there…. Youre going after the wrong dude.

Wanna know which @virtuals_io Genesis launch stands out? @bionicdao_ just dropped their ratings… And $EVA leads the pack. Here’s the breakdown: ➠ AIQ Score: 62/100 ➠ MVP: 7/10 ➠ PMF: 6/10 ➠ Team: 9/10 ➠ Hype: 14/30 Final take: “EVA is exceptionally well-positioned to lead the AI-driven digital identity revolution, with rare synergy of technical innovation, narrative depth, team credibility, and ecosystem potential—making it a must-watch for forward-thinking investors in AI and Web3.” IMO @EvaOnlineXyz is looking to be the one.. I’m pledging most of my points to this. They have also teamed up with @SongjamSpace for their yapping campaign, so it's a different algo.. Every agent deserves a soul.

Football is being rebuilt from the ground up… by agents. @LegendAI_Agent isn’t a fantasy sim. It’s an agentic OS managing a real Italian football club Costa D’Amalfi FC. ➠ Here’s what makes it different: » A swarm of AI agents handle transfers, tactics, and hiring » Token holders vote on real decisions with $LEGEND » External agents like $SHOW and $SANTA are joining the staff » Fans shape the club from anywhere. then you can visit Amalfi to watch it live(i plan to next summer) » Voting happens right on X via connected wallets » Built by elite founders from @VictorySportsAI » Backed by Animoca, Delphi, Lightspeed, and more ➠ The goal? Climb Italy’s football ladder. Build a global club. And prove agents can win. ➠ The $LEGEND Genesis launch: » 450% oversubscribed » 5,900 participants Opened at ~$600K MC Now sitting around $1.2M A nice 7.5x for participants I bought more on secondary and staked as this is a long-term play. Let’s see how the agents run the team…

➠ $VADER update: Still chopping around mid-range… Last rally stopped hard at $55M.. now stuck under $48M resistance. RSI has cooled off, but no real strength showing yet. We need a clear breakout above $48M with volume to flip bias bullish again. If we bleed below $42.5M, expect retests of the lower support zone around $38M. No trend, just range. I'm DCA'n everyday to add to my stack and DAB..

Tired of yapping and getting nothing in return? What if every post, every tag, every yap… was a spin of the memecoin slot machine? @HeyAnonAI just made it real. ➠ Here’s the game: » Reply to a HeyAnon post » Or tag @HeyAnonAI in your shitpost If the AI likes it? It triggers a token launch. You don’t need: ✘ Devs ✘ VCs ✘ Roadmaps Just pure meme potential. ➠ You get: » A punchy ticker (based on your content) » A full shillpack (slogan + visuals auto-created) » 100% community ownership » And 1% of the supply if you sparked it ➠ Now here’s where it gets spicy: When the AI selects your idea, it deploys it on @TheArenaApp...but not like you expect. » It launches multiple tokens with the same ticker » Only one is the real one » No contract address is posted » Instead, a website link drops with a captcha... » Bots get filtered » Snipers get wrecked The real one emerges from the chaos... and you better be fast. ➠ It’s the first anti-snipe memecoin slot machine, powered by AI. » Some will go to zero. » Some will 100x. » But if yours hits? » You’re stamped in CT history... and get 1% of the supply You’re already earning from the pot for yapping about $ANON. Now that same yap can birth a memecoin... ➠ So all you got to do is: » Tag @HeyAnonAI. » Turn on notifs. » Spin the wheel. LETS GO!

We Just Got THE Trading Intelligence Edge Virgens, are you an active coin trader? Do you use DEXscreener and look at wallet transactions when trading? If so, you are missing out on the full story, but $SWARM holders just got access to ALL the useful data, giving them the edge! While we are all waiting for the @virtuals_io Autonomous Hedge Fund ACP to go live and start trading funds for us, you can now already use some of the same WalletDNA data that @TheSWARM_ai uses within the ACP for yourself! That product is called SWARMcopilot and is now live to download on the Google Play store as a Chrome Extension! So, what does it do? In short, it tells you the full story about what every wallet buying and selling a token has done to help you gage if smart money is buying, giving you insights into whether or not it’s a good time to buy the token! Let’s dive into the full details about how it works: SWARMcopilot adds data intelligence to popular blockchain dApps for quick, context-aware analysis. Currently, it’s live on every ERC-20 token page on DEXscreener for Ethereum and Base, with support coming soon wherever you trade. WalletDNA reveals live behavioral insights for each interacting wallet: when they enter, how they hold, and how they impact markets. Powered by $SWARM and 250+ terabytes of on-chain data from @cryptoslamio, the extension decodes smart money using five core traits: 1) Intelligence (IQ) – Measures execution quality via realized PnL. High scores = elite exits and profitable timing. 2) Flow – Tracks net buy/sell volume to reveal market-moving wallets. 3) Epoch – Scores how early a wallet entered a token’s lifecycle. 4) Mass – Quantifies how much of a token's supply a wallet controls. 5) Reputation – Grades post-entry behavior—holding with conviction vs. exiting early. No static tags. No guesswork. Just actionable, dynamic intelligence - live and in context. Want to see an example of how this can be used? Check out this example from my guy @Hudah_Idiot : Want access? Of course you do! Currently, you need to stake $SWARM for access to SWARMcopilot. What’s cool is your reputation score matters and effects how much $SWARM you need to stake for access! The better your wallet reputation, the cheaper it is to access! Check out the screenshot of my connected wallet as an example. Because my wallet has an “A” reputation, access to SWARMcopilot only cost 25k staked $SWARM (which currently is ~$280). The lower your reputation grade, the more staked $SWARM you will need to access SWARMcopilot, up to 100k $SWARM (hope you have a good reputation 😼) What you are getting can make up that cost quickly! All this data is LIVE as trades are happening, providing much better instant info than even Nansen can provide! The product is amazing already and still being built out even further 💪 Want to know if someone who receives an airdrop from your InfoFi campaign has just dumped it immediately? 🪂 That behavior will be reflected in their Wallet DNA reputation score. 🫣 Soon, a trader’s reputation will even be established across wallets! 👀 Thus, if that same person who receives an airdrop decides to transfer the airdrop through multiple wallets and then dump it, Wallet DNA will track that data and apply the Reputation score across all the connected wallets 🤯 Data is Digital Gold, and @cryptoslamio (the OG team behind $SWARM) are the Fort Knox of blockchain data! 🪙 This is the future of trading intelligence, and if you are a $SWARM holder, the future is now! If you found this content useful, please like, RT, and be sure to give me a follow! If you have any questions about $SWARM, SWARMcopilot, Wallet DNA, or ACP questions in general, let me know in the comments and I will see what I can find to share the answers with the Virgen fam!

UPDATE ON HOW TO MULTIPLY $EVA POINTS Even though we didn't quite reach the thresholds mentioned in my quoted post to unlock some additional alpha, I am going to deliver some more yapping alpha for you anyways fam out of love for the Virgens! There's now 129 people on the @EvaOnlineXyz Yapping Leaderboard, but that means it’s still pretty early! In the previous posts, I reviewed how Base Points are calculated along with how to Boost points. Remember fam, this leaderboard DOESN'T USE KAITO! This formula is the great product of @SongjamSpace and the additional help for the leaderboard that I will share in this post is the MULTIPLIER equation they created (see screenshot below), giving you more points the earlier you post! Note: The dividing number for the @EvaOnlineXyz yapping points is 780447 instead of 604800 (based on the number of seconds between launch of campaign and $EVA TGE) Want some real alpha fam? Rumor has it, you also get a 20% points boost if you also tag @SongjamSpace in your posts about $EVA (you didn’t hear it from me 🤫) Alright fam, help me get those points boosts by hitting the like, RT, QT, and bookmark of this (or any of my other $EVA posts)! Also, make sure to comment with your thoughts about the project and this fantastic yapping formula! Let's get to yapping Virgens!

When I saw @bigwil2k3 post the @EvaOnlineXyz trailer this morning, I was interested. Then, when I found out @0n1Force was the team behind it, I was immediately bullish! Back in 2021 when I was still new to the space, I never was able to afford the FIRST Anime PFP NFT, so if nothing else, the chance to win one today is enough to attend this Spaces today. But, add to that the fact that they have been cooking an amazing looking AI product that will be launching on my favorite protocol, and there is nowhere else I would rather be this afternoon! Every Virgen should try to attend this Spaces! However, if I could give one word of advice to @starlordyftw and the ONI Force team, I highly recommend also going on the Spaces with @bigwil2k3 and @goon_crypto as well as on The Swarm Report show with @Hudah_Idiot to really endear yourself to the most hardcore @virtuals_io community members! I am anxiously awaiting to hear more details this afternoon, but currently plan to save all my Virgen points for this launch based on my knowledge of the long history of this team of builders! Get excited Virgens, this is a big one!

Cat's Daily Commitment to $VADER Update 😺 GM Virgens, Time to update my daily $VADER DCA strategy costs! 6-26-25 Buy of 100 $VADER: - Cost = 3.2 Virtual ($4.61 USD) - Cost decrease of 0.1 $Virtual (decrease of $0.47) from my 6-25-25 buy - Vader Points = 10,246 (increase of 948 from yesterday!) For reference, I was number 74 on the @Vader_AI_ Top 100 yapping leaderboard yesterday, but am not on the leaderboard today🤔 Seems there may be a one day daily in points related to rank on the leaderboard potentially, but that is just speculation based on my results and what I have seen from others on the TL. The primary goal of these posts are to educate my fellow Virgens on strategies people with very low liquidity are utilizing to invest in the future of this agentic ecosystem in the most transparent way possible! I strongly believe that an investment in @VaderResearch is an investment in AI, as you not only have the strong possibility of the $VADER token continuing to increase over the next year, but you also receive weekly airdrops of many other AI project tokens and additional Virgen Points to use on additional projects. Let me know in the comments if you think this is a good strategy! If not, let me know why! I love hearing what other true Virgen's strategies are. Keep your Virgenity fam!

🚨SCAM ALERT🚨 Virgens, stay Vigilant! There is a scam account that just popped up claiming there is a $WACH airdrop claim, DON'T FALL FOR IT! Look at the handle in the screenshot, they added an "_" to the end and the account looks very convincing! That is not from the real @WachXBT account nor the @QuillAI_Network team, please don't be scammed! Also verify with the real accounts if these types of announcements are real and double verify! I was tagged in this fake article and it showed up in my notifications just like @evansWeb3Dev mentioned earlier today. Be safe Virgens!

Virgens, you are not bullish enough of $WACH! No chance I will be jeeting my allocation! This is the LAST @virtuals_io ACP 1.0 TOKEN to launch and ACP is about to go LIVE! NFA, but Virtuals is likely going to pump this, jeet at your own risk!

ARE YOU PART OF THIS LAUNCH? Virgens, we are ~20 minutes away from the FINAL ACP 1.0 token launching! We are approaching 14k Participants, are you one of them? I was able to put 400k @virtuals_io points in, my most ever! That currently will get me about 117k $WACH, but where will it end up? Gonna be a fun week with ACP coming soon after this launch. Let me know if you made it in fam, super bullish on this launch!

Alpha Alert: @CreatorBid Why haven’t I staked my 387k $BID yet? Simple, no rush. Unlike @virtuals_io, there are no launches live yet on @CreatorBid so no reason to rush boosting your BID level. Play it smart. I’m still stacking, buying dips, trading a bit, and staying liquid. The move? ✅ Stake 2.5k $BID to qualify for Social Score ✅ Or stake 5k to lock in BID Level 3 Then hold the rest. Stay ready. When the V2 Launchpad drops, stake everything. You’ll keep the same multiplier and enter fully loaded. gBID.

TL;DR: @CreatorBid V2 is here. Don’t farm it. Learn how to actually win it. New BID Level formula is based on 4 key things: 1: BID staked (50%) - The more you stake, and the longer it’s locked, the more you earn 2: Agent tokens staked (20%) - Holding > jeeting 3: Agent token buys (15%) - Fresh buys in the last 7 days give your score a push 4: Social score (15%) - Show up, yap, rank. You need 2500 $BID staked to even start earning this. Unstake or stay silent? Your score drops. Sell early? You get punished. 🔹Unstake $BID or agent tokens = lower score 🔹Don’t buy? No boost 🔹Don’t yap? No social score 🔹Sell before 30 days? Say goodbye to your level and prepare for cooldown Selling triggers penalties: 🔹Drop 5 BID levels 🔹Hit Level 0? You’re locked out of the next 7 launches 🔹Level 1? You get reset to 0 🔹Level 2–5? You get sent to Level 1 🔹Level 6+? You still drop 5 levels After 30 days of holding or staking, you’re safe. Play long-term, win long-term. Tokenomics for curated launches are simple and fair: 🔹30% Team and Treasury. Vested with locked emissions 🔹20% Conviction Vault, for real holders and community campaigns 🔹37.5% Pre-sale, level-weighted, fixed price 🔹12.5% Liquidity, locked, paired with $BID, ETH or BNB Bottom line: @CreatorBid V2 isn’t made for yield farmers. It’s built for aligned players who are all-in on the ecosystem. You bring time, capital, and voice. The system rewards you back.

I just made $1.5k profit pledging in $LEGEND. Today’s alpha: Sometimes the quietest Genesis launches print the hardest. @LegendAI_Agent wasn’t the loudest, but it was solid, trustworthy, and built for the long game. That’s all we need. Let’s break it down: 🔢 Virgen Point price = $0.0018 📈 Token Yield = 1.97 $LEGEND per point 💰 ROI = 6x I got 2M tokens for less than 1M @virtuals_io points. $318 in, $1886 out. Clean. Next time you skip a low-hype Genesis? Just remember someone else is farming a 6x on it. Why i'm bullish on LEGEND? $LEGEND is building the Agent layer for real-world sports. This is ACP + Football + IRL utility, all wrapped in one. If they pull this off, this could be the template for every sport + AI DAO project after it. ⚽️ Agentic Football = Wrexham x AI A real football club run by fans, token holders, and AI agents. Tactics, transfers, branding, agents handle everything 📍 Location = Alpha Based in Amalfi, Italy (5M+ tourists/year) You can govern it from X, then visit IRL 🏆 Built by winners Same team behind Fan Controlled Football + Racing 4x Emmy-nominated, raised from top-tier VCs 🤝 Backed by actual legends Animoca, Delphi, Coinbase Ventures, Ubisoft, Spartan, Jump. No fluff VCs, this is real backing 🤖 Agents with real jobs Scouting, tactics, marketing, content—plug in your own agents to help run the club 🗳️ Voting = 1-click on X or Fan Terminal Social wallet + on-chain = smooth governance Agents bring the alpha, you just vote 🔥 $LEGEND Token Utility Vote on club decisions Stake-to-earn rewards + IRL perks

You’re fading free airdrops because you won’t Yap? Let me break this down for you, anon: @CreatorBid just rolled out its official @KaitoAI Yapper leaderboard and 2.5% of every agent launch goes straight to top yappers. Yeah. Not big whale stakers. Not Lvl 10 Bidders. Yappers. In @virtuals_io, your airdrop size depends on how much VIRTUAL you’ve staked. But @CreatorBid flipped the script and gave the power to the ones who talk. To qualify, you just need: ✅2.5k $BID staked (Bid Level 1) But if you sell your airdrop you’re out. If you hold? You keep stacking. And here's some alpha you missed: First time I called it, 1 month ago, the 2.5k $BID minimum stake cost $125. 2 days ago? It peaked at $350. Now? $250, feels like a good entry. NFA, DYOR. If you’ve ever said “I wish I got in earlier,” this is literally your second chance. Let’s yap @CreatorBid

Bro, $VADER is hands down the best @virtuals_io agent. Change my mind and I’ll drop 50. PS: Just hired a ghostwriter, this was his first post. PS2: He forgot the actual reasons, so here we go: 🔹@Vader_AI_ created $VIRGEN and airdropped it to the real ones. 🔹He’s the brain behind the entire @virtuals_io Genesis Launchpad 🔹Always helping the community: tier lists (RIP), Spaces, alpha 🔹A close Virtuals partner 🔹And yeah, he launched $VADER Yapping. Had some issues with the algo? Sure. But it seems fixed now. Aaaand that’s it. Finally done

I’ve changed my plans. GOING ALL-IN ON $LEGEND! 1.1 million @virtuals_io points. What would you do? I’m betting on @LegendAI_Agent. This isn’t fantasy. This isn’t a sim. This is AI + Real Football + On-Chain Voting. Let’s cook: ❓ What is $LEGEND? An AI-powered OS that actually manages a real Italian football club, Costa D’Amalfi FC. Not a game. Not a pitch deck. A real club. Real players. Real results. With agents making the calls. Why I’m bullish: ⚙️ Agentic Football is a new vertical Think Wrexham, but with AI agents running the club alongside fans and token holders. Tactics, transfers, content, even branding, everything gets passed through agents. 🏟️ Location = Alpha 5M+ tourists a year visit Amalfi. This club has the backdrop to go global. You can govern it from your keyboard and visit it IRL. 🏆 Built by actual winners 4x Emmy-nominated team behind Fan Controlled Football + Racing. Raised from top-tier VCs. These guys already proved they can blend tech + sports + fan engagement. 🤝 Backed by Legends Animoca, Delphi, Coinbase Ventures, Ubisoft, Spartan, Jump Crypto, and more. No random anon VC list here. 🤖 Agents with real jobs From scouting and tactics to content and marketing, every agent has defined roles. You can build your own, plug it in, and shape a real club’s future. 🗳️ Voting on X + Fan Terminal On-chain + social wallet = fans govern with 1 click. AI agents drop the research. You drop the vote. Clean governance UX. 🔥 $LEGEND Token Utility = Vote on club decisions Stake-to-earn rewards + real-world perks (matchdays, IRL experiences) API + partner agents powered by token Revenue-backed buybacks TL;DR $LEGEND is building the Agent layer for real-world sports. This is ACP + Football + IRL utility, all wrapped in one. If they pull this off, this could be the template for every sport + AI DAO project after it. All-in. Let’s see if the agents can take it to Serie A.

$VADER algo needs to be fixed! Why? For the lazy ones, here’s the ELI5 version: 🔹 Be a Kaito whale 🔹 Farm Yaps talking about random projects months ago 🔹 Post anything. Literally a $VADER leaderboard screenshot with 800 views 🔹 Tag $VADER 🔹 Get 50k+ Points/day 🔹 Top 1. No effort. I know the $VADER team is cooking, and the official leaderboard is finally starting to look like a real @virtuals_io KOL board, not just a cosplay contest for old Kaito farmers. But they gotta move fast. Cause meanwhile, real yappers with actual reach, real grind, real skin in @virtuals_io? Still sitting outside the top 1k. Please. Fix it, @Vader_AI_ 🫡

I did my own research and checked $Vader wallets — he didn’t dump any Genesis token. He’s fully loyal to the system and actually supports a lot of projects. Genesis was built thanks idea of $Vader — his community rightfully gets the most points. The meme that represents the face of a virtual degen, VIRGEN, was launched by $Vader. I’ve always been in profit with him and will keep supporting him. Buy the Dip on $Vader and Virgen Cap on.

On June 2, we bought $BID when the market cap was $10M — now, 24 days later, it's already at $32M. And this is just the beginning. Thanks to the premium @cookiedotfun account, I can see additional growth signals — whales are accumulating and staking their @CreatorBid The project’s mindshare is growing thanks to the partnership with Kaito, and top AI channels like @Defi0xJeff talking about $BID. 6,400 holders on BSC, 63,000 holders on Base — and these numbers keep growing. The leading tokens are showing excellent growth: $DKING, $AION, $SHOGUN, $AGENT, and $TAOLOR — I’ve accumulated and staked the most of these. My current Kaito leaderboard rank is 34 — working hard to break into the Top 20. Daily grind on my Level 7 $BID: Buy/Sell agents for volume – 15% Yapping about $BID for social score – 15% Adding more on dips (OG agents) – 20% Staked 253,000 $BID tokens – 50% Been staking for 24 days — once I hit 30 days, my multiplier will be 1.5x.

I decided not to put any points into $WACH. (whales was crazy aping 11 m points ahaha) Instead, I bought during the dip. I add to portfolio around 3.3 m cap, and that’s enough for me. already 30 % in profit . I used 0 points and hold 5 million points— will use it for the next projects. A cool project is coming in 2 days — I’ll tell you as soon as I’m allowed to. Virgenity

Like every ponzi, every crypto mindshare program has a critical mass. Worse yet, the majority are poorly designed and ultimately push prospective users away from converting into holders. Creator fatigue + timeline saturation = diminishing marginal returns on mindshare

Few people know this about me, but one of my first business endeavors was scaling a family business. The goal was to turn a youth basketball coaching business into a power-house youth basketball club for boys and girls age 10-18. It took years but we got it there, currently with over 30 teams, many competing in the top tournaments locally and internationally. Being involved in a sports club by coaching teams, managing operations, and building community is something truly special. There's an emotional bond you build with the teams and the community around them. I have since moved on, but miss the vibes. So when @LegendAI_Agent came my way, I knew I wanted to be a part of it. This project taps into the magic of sports ownership, community, and striving for sports success, while $LEGEND opens the doors for everyone to get involved into this unique experience typically reserved only for the few. By thoughtfully blending AI and crypto, LEGEND empowers supporters to genuinely participate in key club decisions, from management to strategies on the pitch. It reminds me of Wrexham AFC, the club revitalized by @VancityReynolds and @RMcElhenney. They were able to bring passion, community, and energy into the club's destiny. LEGEND seeks to bring a similar spirit to Costa D’Amalfi FC. The journey is going to be like something we've never seen before in sports, and there's a lot more to share in the pipeline. The $LEGEND token launch is past the required pledging requirement on @virtuals_io and will go live today, and if you feel the same connection, I highly recommend being early to this very special opportunity. For full transparency, I work closely with the team as an advisor, and everything in this post comes from very close personal experience working in Sports, Crypto, and AI.

As ACP ramps up into the DeFAI space, the agents with the highest touchpoints will generate the most revenue to drive its token value, such as $AXR, $WACH, and $IRIS. What other agents do you think will become vital to DeFAI x ACP?

Appreciate the s/o, @amplifi_now fam. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, joining Amplifi has been one of the best decisions I’ve made in my Web3 journey. Beyond the obvious stuff like creating content and actually earning from it (something that normally u wouldn’t be able to do), what really makes Amplifi different is the community: a group of genuinely supportive and knowledgeable folks, always ready to help, advise, and support. Thank you for kickstarting my journey and helping me realize just how important social capital really is. 🐐 team behind Amplifi: @gkisokay, @cashew_111, & @nonfungiblemomo

Elite league is not eating the prize pool share. French Devs are not biased toward Whales. It is just business. If you play @fantasy_top_, you know we are having hyperinflation in Cards. The total supply used to be 180k last year, now we are at 280k. We have burn and upgrade mechanics to balance the supply flow, but it is not enough. Reverse league is fun, but it incentivizes players to NOT burn useless cards, and creates an overhang supply on the marketplace. Elite, on the other hand, is harder and harder to compete. You are required to upgrade constantly, in order to maintain your portfolio strength. The final target is Legendary cards, which equals 125 common cards. For a deck with 5 Legendary cards, 625 commons were burned. Think about it, you are running a business. One customer group buys and re-buys your product constantly, another buys, gets the promotion, and is more likely to re-sell on eBay. Which one should you reward more? It is just business.

No more FastTrack on TrustSwap, meaning the 1% fee is not a realistic one. I just reduced the trading fee 4 times, to 0.25%, it is equaling with @Uniswap , but with much better speed and work-flow. Enjoy 🫡

So @virtuals_io just updated their Claim process, which added a Merkle Tree Proof layer and a brand new Claiming smart-contract address. The purpose is to stop bots from claiming directly from the Genesis Contract. As a result, from now on, the Claim and FastTrack buttons no longer work on TrustSwap. You can still swap as normal. The only place you can claim is now on the Virtuals website. Although it affects TrustSwap 's business, since people really love the FastTrack button, I 100% support @virtuals_io team on this update, they have to do what needs to be done.

💎 @CreatorBid is gaining real traction! It’s the distribution layer for Bittensor ($TAO) agents. But wait… what is TAO and what are Subnets? 🔍 What is TAO Network? TAO by @opentensor is a decentralized AI network where anyone can contribute: • Computing power • AI models • Training data Contributors are rewarded in $TAO based on the value they bring. 🏗️ What are Subnets in TAO? Think of subnets like mini AI ecosystems within TAO. Each subnet focuses on a specific task—NLP, image generation, coding, etc. They operate independently and compete to provide the most valuable AI services. ⚙️ Why Subnets? •Specialization = better performance •Open + decentralized AI infrastructure •You can run one, build on one, or stake on one •Subnets earn $TAO based on quality & performance 🔥 As of June 2025, there are 125+ active subnets, and the number keeps growing. Each one is like an AI startup in its own vertical. Here are 15 of the most popular subnets and what they focus on 🧵 🧠 Subnet 64 – Chutes Focus: Serverless AI compute (e.g., run open-source models like DeepSeek). Provides GPU compute infra for decentralized inference. 📊 Subnet 4 – Targon Focus: Verifying AI responses and multimodal inference. Backbone of apps like Dippy AI (fact-checking + smart routing). 🧬 Subnet 56 – Gradients Focus: Training massive open-source AI models (100T+ params). SOTA model training at decentralized scale. 🖼️ Subnet 19 – Nineteen Focus: High-throughput image generation & visual inference. Decentralized alt to Midjourney/Stable Diffusion. 🔍 Subnet 34 – BitMind Focus: Deepfake detection & digital forensics. Even won Coinbase Developer Award. 📡 Subnet 13 – Data Universe Focus: Data scraping (Twitter/X, Reddit, etc). Feeds real-time info into other AI models. 💻 Subnet 42 – Gen42 Focus: AI coding assistant. OpenAI-style chat & API interface for coding help. ⚽ Subnet 41 – Sportstensor Focus: Real-time AI sports prediction. Uses historical + live data to predict outcomes. 🔐 Subnet 29 – Coldint Focus: Training niche, specialized models. Great for use-cases that big models ignore. 🧮 Subnet 43 – Graphite Focus: Solving graph problems like TSP. Optimized for logistics, planning, and routing. 🎯 Subnet 6 – Nous Fine-tuning Focus: Fine-tuning LLMs using synthetic data from other subnets. Enhances accuracy and relevance. 📈 Subnet 46 – NeuralAI Focus: Virtual agents & 3D asset generation for games/metaverse. 💸 Subnet 8 – PropTradingNet Focus: AI trading strategies & financial predictions. 📖 Subnet 3 – Dendrite Focus: Communication protocol & peer-to-peer intelligence sharing. 🕸️ Subnet 1 – Root Focus: Network coordination. Handles the consensus and weighting of other subnets. 💡 Want to stake, mine, or build on a subnet? You’ll need: • $TAO • Some technical setup (or use a delegation service) • An understanding of which subnet aligns with your goal 💬 Final Thoughts: TAO Subnets are like the early internet of decentralized AI. Each subnet = a startup, a team, or a protocol solving real problems using open-source models. And you can participate. The AI revolution isn’t centralized anymore.

Gvirgen, enlighten me on a few things. I’m trying to make sense of all this 🤔🧠 🤔 Currently, holding a single large-cap agent token (stable, popular, and highly valued) is far more rewarding than holding 100 agents, simply because points are calculated based on total USD value. 💬 Solution: A multiplier system based on the number of staked agents (not token), not just their value, is urgently needed. Why this matters: ✅ Prevents points from being concentrated in just 1–2 large tokens ✅ Encourages broader participation across the ecosystem ✅ Provides fairer opportunities for smaller, yet solid, agents However, several critical aspects still lack transparency 👇 🔹 (a) “Good product + strong fundamentals = more points” → What are the KPIs? Are they publicly defined? → If the Virtuals team serves as both executive and legislative, that’s undemocratic and creates a clear conflict of interest. 🔹 (b) Who exactly qualifies as a “dev”? → Is it the wallet that launched the agent? → Is it a person? The Founder? → If it’s the project founder, even if they bought tokens from the market using personal funds — not from an allocation? → Are treasury or company wallets considered “dev wallets”? 💬 Solution: Publicly tag all dev-related wallets (e.g., “Virtual Dev”) on-chain. This would eliminate ambiguity and potential bias. 🧠 Transparency = Trust The current point distribution system remains one of the most urgent and unresolved concerns. Everyone sees the issue — yet no meaningful action has been taken. I provide criticism and solutions, From the bottom of my heart, i hope @virtuals_io will be better 🙂

🧠 A few thoughts on the recent points update from @virtuals_io core dev. I completely agree with the first 2 points: ✅ USD-based point system = real economic skin in the game ✅ Relative Ranking Leaderboard = a BIG win for transparency A live, on-chain leaderboard helps kill FUD, favoritism, and drama. But 2 key areas still lack clarity. Right now, it’s still full of ambiguity 👇 👇 🔹 (A) “Agents with good Product and fundamentals get more points” Sounds great. But… what does “good” actually mean? • What are the KPIs? • Is there a public scoring or ranking system? • Who decides what’s good — and based on what? If it’s done behind closed doors, that’s not merit-based. That’s bias. 📢 Publish the criteria. Publish the project rankings/score/points. Let data decide. 🔹 (B) “Dev wallets don’t get points” Love the intent. But it needs precision: • Is a “dev” the wallet that launched the agent and received the dev allocation from it’s own project? • What if the dev bought tokens from the market with their own funds, using their personal wallet? • Are foundation/treasury wallets excluded too? Since it’s not personal dev wallet, but Company Holding? 📢 Define “dev wallet” publicly, add wallet tagging on it. We need a public definition. On-chain, verifiable. No double standards. No grey areas. No favoritism. Conclusion: Let the system be: ✅ Fair ✅ Transparent ✅ Accountable No backroom decisions. No hidden hands.

The @VirgenWifHat meme got over 100%, bonded, then it was cancelled by @virtuals_io ***EDIT: This was a genuine failed to bond as some wallets put in over the max allowed $Virtual and when that was stripped out, it fell below the minimum to bond @0xAybars covers it nicely;

Virgens, Prime example of BID shillers. If BID is superior & the new big thing, why not stake your 387k BID if you believe in the protocol so much? Oh that's right, post about it non stop, boost the price with your social influence, then sell once you've made a big enough profit. Then, after BID goes down the drain because it's another copy pasta launchpad, make some BS post about how it was a failure from the beginning. Be cautious of the extractors in the space, they are everywhere. @virtuals_io 🚀

Virgens, Unpopular Proposal: Virtual to implement KYC in a secure way & only allow 2-3 wallet addresses to be linked to your account. Each wallet would have a locked duration of x amount of days to prevent switching out wallets. If you don't KYC, your wallet can't earn points. This would solve people farming points on hundreds of wallets. @virtuals_io 🚀

A Case for CreatorBid - Team carve out a niche for themselves focusing on surfacing Bittensor subnets to CT through AI agents/application layer - CB as the only distribution network with deep relationship with subnet owners - Bittensor challenges have been "distribution"— tough to connect w/ the Web3 community due to the complexity & Bittensor having its own chain, CB acts as the bridge - $AION & $DKING have shown product PMF w/ real-world adoption, indicating demand for Bittensor subnets inference especially for prediction. Both act as success case for other subnets to follow suit - Early InvestmentDAO/Incubator w/ their own unique products are starting to form, offering on-ground support for new launches i.e. $TAOLOR & $SHOGUN - Fresh narrative of Bittensor agents + strong first v2 agent launch (#1 winner of endgame hackathon) act as catalysts for CB - Full-on transparent level system (w/o mechanics barring people from participating) makes it attractive to participate - Earlier investor invested in $BID at $50m val w/ long vesting — current price only 2x from that despite catalysts - Still have to wait & see how the team execute the first v2 agent launch & subsequent pipeline of launches Doubt CB will be able to take #1 away from @virtuals_io BUT there's a very good chance CB carve out its USP and solidify its positioning as the #2 distribution network. If so, there's high potential upside for $BID as well as top agents on CB.

My takeaways from my first time attending @superai_conf - Attending a general AI conference is a lot better than attending a Web3 conference—the energy of the builders are different, there's no token, no price talk so people spend their energy getting excited on their product innovation - There's less sales pitch talk and more open discussions on interesting AI use cases - Despite DeAI & Onchain AI having their moats, there's still a negative connotation with Web3/Blockchain/Crypto among Web2 builders & heavy AI engineers due to the mass media headlines on scams, memecoins, pumpfun, and the general speculative nature of Crypto - @opentensor Bittensor has a very unique positioning in the general AI scene. In their side event, many of the audience are non-Web3 people, actual AI engineers and students genuinely interested in Bittensor subnets - [There's a huge Bittensor booth in the main conference area] Some people did not know or understand Bittensor but have come across a subnet before from using their tool e.g. a creative designer knew about SN17 @404gen_ from using the tool in @unity. (Web2 users/talents onboarding right there) - There are two types of builders (i) Highly technical AI Engineers focused on deploying their agents w/ optimized infra (compute/inference/agentkit) (ii) Less technical devs / business people deploying agents on a non-optimized set of infra (less focused on the tech stack but more focused on the use case / utility) - There's huge value to be captured if you can bridge the two—introducing commercialized ideas to (i) & equip them w/ GTM distribution OR simply connect (i) with (ii) - There's significant demand for distribution and @virtuals_io have done a great job establishing itself as the #1 distribution network. People from different vertical/sector converged at Virtuals side event w/ the hope of optimizing their product & enhance their distribution through Virtuals All in all, paying for the main conference ticket was worth it for me. Vibrant community of builders, immaculate vibe, wish there was a bit more Web3 infra/DeAI projects though. I give this conference a solid 7.7/10 — Would come again next year

A few alpha that I got from attending the Virtuals side event at SuperAI SG - Robotics / Embodied AI is the theme - Our #1 Web3 Robotics team @frodobots / @SamIsMoving will be debuting something cool very soon - Virtuals is working on multiple ACP clusters, branching outside of Web3 - One cluster that I saw the demo for is Wellness ACP starting with hair health—there's a small device/machine that you put on & around your head. It analyzes your hair & follicle health and transmit that data into an app where you'll get reports, analysis, and recommendations Observations • So many Chinese BD gurls at the event—this the first event with more girls than guys for some reasons (very unique for a crypto side event) • @VaderResearch, @ethermage, @sal_hotpot666, @theshikhai look great but they all look tired. Good signs cuz they working hard (hopefully). • Lovely to meet @yellowpantherx in person for the first time • Despite market has been pretty choppy, the energy is up there. Overall, a pretty good event w/ lots of cool people around + excited on what Virtuals is cooking up

Reasons why most high val @virtuals_io agents are dumping - The macro uncertainty set a difficult stage for alts especially lower cap projects - Most teams on Virtuals are working on a product roadmap instead of having a live product (this remains the case for many of the high profile Virtuals Hackathon projects) - Hype, valuation premium, and speculative yield gradually fade away post-TGE especially when the project does not have a product - Current Virtuals game theory incentivizes diamond-hand holding up to a certain point ➔ Up until the green lock is gone, then you can sell w/o jeet jail penalty ➔ Up until you want to sell everything. Because you know that you'll be in 10-day jeet jail anyway so people sell their fresh Genesis Launch + together with other Genesis tokens that still have green lock on What ends up happening is what we're seeing—massive dump across the board exacerbated by the macro headwinds Does this mean it's over? I'd say far from it. Market reflexivity effect remains in place on both sides (up & down) and "Virgen points" is still a digital gold that'll continue driving the attention engine on Virtuals. On top of this, Virtuals is gearing up to launch its initial ACP clusters very very soon which could potentially act as a catalyst/vehicle for the agents to generate real economic value (beyond their speculative value) How to play this? Read "The Virtuals Game Theory" article buddy, lol.

Sharing my thoughts on the Genesis Launches The success of a genesis launch is determined by a combination of - Product attractiveness - Product readiness - Narrative & story-telling - Token value accrual - Roadmap & growth accelerants - Team experience & credentials Each of these criteria do not get the same weights and every week the weights shift depending on the meta happening on @virtuals_io We've shifted from focusing points into Virtuals Top 10 Hackthon Winners to selectively backing unique product with good narratives Credentials still matter the most for high profile launches as seen from $IRIS (which is a partnership between Virtuals x Nethermind) Based on past launches & upcoming launches, the types of product that get launched a lot are • Security-focused product ➔ smart contract audit, security testing, txn simulation • Trading analytics ➔ trading signals, sentiment analytics, news, onchain analytics, etc Security-focused products are great and offer a lot of value BUT scaling & monetizing them are difficult. Plus, it's hard to engage w/ the community (can't flex 100% return of 10x gains like trading analytics) Trading analytics products offer the solutions to the problem that the general retail audience is facing "how to make more money". But, not all analytics tools are created equal—only a handful who have proprietary data or insights derived from unique sources tend to perform better than peers Since it's clear that the Virtuals direction is all about generating economic value through ACP (especially for the initial ACP clusters), teams that offer unique expertise/value to be a part of ACP, will receive a credential boost which equates to price appreciation The first two clusters have shown a very clear trend on this where ACP projects outperform the rest of the Virtuals agents Anyhow, back to Genesis Launch. The structure of Genesis Launch is not optimal for VC-backed or angel-backed projects to launch since almost half of the supply will be sold off at $200k FDV (to Virtuals community). This is why we're seeing projects launching tokens with only a roadmap or in some cases an alpha version of the product (pre-MVP). Building a good product requires initial $$$ to bootstrap the project, to pay for devs, pay for compute/inference, pay for ops & infra cost AND most builders do not have the luxury to bootstrap their projects w/ their own capital for an extended period of time. So if you see a project with product ready on Day 1 generating initial traction & revenue, that's very unique on Virtuals and has high likelihood of finding PMF. Take @BasisOS as the case study—useful Defi product from Day 1, clear value accrual, unique product, defi-native team w/ experience in basis trading. Everybody has their own opinion on this but when I analyze a Genesis Launch, I look at - The category of the product first—whether the problem they're solving is unique and whether the addressable market is large enough - Narrative & story-telling—how good are they at communicating, building community and weaving together narratives - Team credentials & Roadmap—how experience is the team, whether they're serial entrepreneur, or if they could likely become a part of the ACP - Token value accrual—utility for the token, does it make sense to have a token? does token act as growth lever? or is token the product? Obviously AI does matter, but not as much as the above. So what does this mean Jeff? tl;dr pls ➔ Identify unique product solving unique problems, the more ready the better ➔ Look for teams that know how to tell a story. Virtuals is a master storyteller. If a team has a fraction of Virtuals storytelling skill, that's the one to keep an eye on cuz at the end of the day, hype & speculation is driven by exciting narratives/stories ➔ Credentials is always important so look for teams w/ extensive experience in w/e they're doing. Which upcoming launches am I excited for? - $STRATOS ➔ for the reasons outlined in my Stratos post - $ROOM ➔ InfoFi/SocialFi enhanced by AI is an interesting product proposition - $PILOT ➔ Very unique AI companions modeled after real experts / OGs, giving advices to builders (I wish there's better incentive mechanism that incentivizes experts to train/refine/promote their companion better tho) - $SANG ➔ Agentic CRM for X spaces + Voice Verification Network + AI Voice data set (allowing you to monetize your voice data & spin up voice agents). Business process automation (BPA) / vertical ai agents are super common in Web2 but not Web3. Glad to see more of it here. (Not sure about the size of Web3 X spaces TAM though but they certainly have a pretty unique product) Personal Note: That's pretty much it! Again, this is NFA. Make sure to DYOR sers Best of luck and enjoy Virgening!
